# constellations-raylib
WIP â€¢ Windows only

The classic Constellations coding exercise ~~written in C and compiled to WebAssembly to render on a &lt;canvas> in the browser with help from [alextyner/wasm-canvas](https://github.com/alextyner/wasm-canvas).  
It's my Wallpaper Engine background now ;)~~

## Compiling
1. Install [raylib](https://raysan5.itch.io/raylib/purchase)
2. `$ make`
