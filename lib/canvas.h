/**
 * Struct containing state and OO-like behavior of a CanvasRenderingContext2D structured similarly
 * to how it would be exposed in JavaScript. This struct should not be instantiated, but rather 
 * obtained from an HTMLCanvas struct by calling its getContext() function pointer.
 * 
 * Function pointers in this struct can be called in an almost identical manner to their JavaScript
 * equivalents, with a few idiomatic-C quirks. Firstly, every function takes as its first parameter
 * a pointer to the struct itself. It's hard to access the struct's state within the function otherwise
 * since we are just simulating OO. Secondly, some function parameters differ slightly from the JS
 * implementations because we don't have overloading in C. For example, the fillText() function
 * always expects the optional 'maxWidth' property. That parameter will be ignored if you provide a
 * negative value, and there are comments written below with that and similar information.
 * 
 * You might notice that a lot of functions expect double parameters. That's because most of the
 * equivalent JavaScript functions will accept doubles. Don't worry, providing int parameters will
 * work just fine. (int) -> (double) is an implicit conversion in C; no cast required.
 * 
 * To summarize, a typical use of this struct might look like the following:
 * 
 *     HTMLCanvas *canvas = createCanvas("myCanvas");
 *     CanvasRenderingContext2D *ctx = canvas->getContext(canvas, "2d"); // only 2d is supported currently
 *     ctx->setFillStyle(ctx, "#FF0000");
 *     printf("I set the fill style to %s\n", ctx->getFillStyle(ctx));
 *     ctx->fillRect(ctx, 50, 75, 100, 200);
 *     freeCanvas(canvas);
 * 
 * Some state is pseudo-encapsulated in the 'private' member struct, such as pointers to dynamically
 * allocated strings that will need to be freed when the HTMLCanvas is freed. Typically these
 * are from JavaScript calls, allocated to return them to the user. Alternatively, functions
 * with canonical string return types could be pigeon-holed into returning enum types, or
 * we could make the user responsible for buffer allocation and expect an additional by-reference
 * parameter to copy the string into. The in-JavaScript allocated string would need to be
 * freed after returning its contents to the user, and the user would not know how large the buffer
 * should be. So, when a string is exposed to the user, this struct keeps track of the pointers in
 * order to free them when the HTMLCanvas parent struct is freed.
